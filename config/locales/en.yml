# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        "The Japanese word DOJO (dōjō (道場)) literally means 'place of the way' and we have recreated this concept in our gym. A DOJO is a place for immersive learning, healing, and meditation.
        Using powerful holistic tools such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Movement, and Yoga we apply this Dojo concept at the heart of Berlin-Neukölln. Our goal is to promote a safe, welcoming, injury-free and family friendly environment so that we improve not only our technical qualities but along the journey or thoughts, words and actions.
        We are affiliated with CheckMat and we look forward to meet each CheckMat brother and sister, who is visiting Berlin.
        ... and If you are looking for a new BJJ School in Berlin, come to a trial class!"
